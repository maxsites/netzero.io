title: "Step 11: Erect ground floor SIPs"

Floor joists complete; Backfill complete; Ground floor SIPs are being erected. 

What are SIPs and why did we use them?  

SIPs (see [http://www.r-control.com/](http://www.r-control.com/) and [http://www.premiersips.com/about-premier-sips/features-benefits/](http://www.premiersips.com/about-premier-sips/features-benefits/)) are super-insulating rigid insulation laminated to high-performance engineered wood sheathing.  SIPs have the following advantages over a conventionally built "stick frame" home:

* stronger: up to 66% stronger; to make our house even more secure for seismic activity, we built shear walls into certain panels 
* straighter: built in a factory with better tolerances than framing "in the field"
* better insulated: R-value is much higher than the R-value of a 2x4@16" or even a 2x6@24" wall
* tighter sealed: air leakage is up to 90% less than stick-built homes
* lower operating costs/less energy needed to heat and cool: high R-values plus low air leakage = reduced HVAC requirements
* more comfortable: better air quality and reduced external noise; note we used low VOC sealants
* faster construction: the panels can be put together quite quickly so construction time is lower than a conventionally built house, particularly if you include insulation
* Furthermore, because the product is made in a factory, there is far less material waste than what is experienced building a conventional home.  For example, we have a very, very small pile of debris from the last four weeks of construction.  Homes built conventionally have large debris piles and require frequent waste removal.  Finally, the wood used is from renewable controlled growth wood resources and the rigid insulation is from partially recycled material.  See [the energy savings](http://www.r-control.com/energy-savings.asp).  We used r-control SIPs in our house and worked with Jim Crowley at Crowley Builders, Inc.
