We purchased windows and doors from [America Italiana](http://www.americaitaliana.com/), a terrific company representing [Sferagroup](http://www.sfera-group.it/english/), an Italian firm.

The windows are high performance ([Passive House certified](http://www.passivehouse.us/passiveHouse/PassiveHouseInfo.html), triple pane, etc.) European style (tilt and turn) windows with the best aesthetics and features (pull down shades and screens built into the frame) we found on the market.

To meet the Passive House standard, windows are manufactured with exceptionally high R-values (low U-values, typically â‰¤ 0.14 Btu/hr-ft2-°F (0.8 W/m2/K) for the entire window including the frame). These normally combine triple-pane insulated glazing (with a good solar heat-gain coefficient (SHGC), low-emission coatings, sealed argon or krypton gas filled glass spacer, and ‘warm edge’ insulating glass spacers) with air-seals and specially developed thermally broken window frames. In Central Europe and most of the United States, for unobstructed south-facing Passive House windows, the heat gains from the sun are, on average, greater than the heat losses, even in mid-winter. This [link](http://www.americaitaliana.com/showcase-palo-alto-c.html) shows a cross-section of our window as well as the finished product in the factory.

In summary, these windows are beautiful, energy efficient, extraordinarily well insulated, fully featured, flexible, pre-wired for alarms and virtually impossible to break. Piero at American Italiano is extraordinarily talented and helpful. The windows shipped and arrived on schedule. They have Italian design and German hardware. What more could you ask for?
